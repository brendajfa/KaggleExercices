def blackjack_hand_greater_than(hand_1, hand_2):
    
    Return True if hand_1 beats hand_2, and False otherwise.

    In order for hand_1 to beat hand_2 the following must be true:
    - The total of hand_1 must not exceed 21
    - The total of hand_1 must exceed the total of hand_2 OR hand_2's total must exceed 21

    Hands are represented as a list of cards. Each card is represented by a string.

    When adding up a hand's total, cards with numbers count for that many points. Face
    cards ('J', 'Q', and 'K') are worth 10 points. 'A' can count for 1 or 11.

    When determining a hand's total, you should try to count aces in the way that
    maximizes the hand's total without going over 21. e.g. the total of ['A', 'A', '9'] is 21,
    the total of ['A', 'A', '9', '3'] is 14.

    Examples:
   # >>> blackjack_hand_greater_than(['K'], ['3', '4'])
    True
    #>>> blackjack_hand_greater_than(['K'], ['10'])
    False
    #>>> blackjack_hand_greater_than(['K', 'K', '2'], ['3'])
    False
    
    pass
